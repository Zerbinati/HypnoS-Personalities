    "explanation": {
        "Aggressiveness": "Nimzowitsch was primarily a positional player, but he also sought control of the board. Increased to 35 so he actively fights for space and initiative.",
        "RiskTaking": "Although cautious, he was not completely risk-averse. Setting this to 30 allows him to take more strategic risks when needed.",
        "KingSafety": "King safety remains important but reduced to 25 so he doesn\u2019t over-prioritize passive safety.",
        "PieceActivity": "Nimzowitsch's hypermodern style relied on active piece play. Increasing this to 90 ensures he maneuvers pieces effectively.",
        "PawnStructure": "He strongly emphasized structure and prophylaxis. Keeping this high at 65 maintains his solid positional foundation.",
        "KnightPair": "Bonus for keeping both knights. He valued maneuvering, but knights were not his primary focus, so 60 is assigned.",
        "BishopPair": "Though he favored minor piece maneuvering, bishops were strong in his plans, hence 55.",
        "Defense": "Nimzowitsch was highly prophylactic, but reducing defense to 60 ensures he isn\u2019t too passive.",
        "CalculationDepth": "His deep strategic vision is reflected by increasing CalculationDepth to 18 for better planning.",
        "EndgameKnowledge": "He excelled in endgames due to structural mastery. Keeping this high at 90 ensures strong endgame play.",
        "PieceSacrifice": "Though not a tactical player, he sometimes sacrificed pieces for positional gains. Increasing to 35 allows for calculated sacrifices."
